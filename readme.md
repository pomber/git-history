# [Git History](https://githistory.xyz)

Quickly browse the history of files in any git repo:

1. Go to a file in **GitHub** (or **GitLab**, or **Bitbucket**)
1. Replace `github.com` with `github.githistory.xyz`
1. There's no step three

[Try it](https://github.githistory.xyz/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babel-core/test/browserify.js)

  var regEx = /^(https?\:\/\/)(www\.)?(github|gitlab|bitbucket)\.(com|org)\/(.*)$/i;
  if (regEx.test(url)) {
    url = url.replace(regEx, "$1$3.githistory.xyz/$5");
    window.open(url, "_blank");
  } else {
    alert("Not a Git File URL");
  }
})();
```

</details>

### Local Repos

You can use Git History for local git repos with the [CLI](https://github.com/pomber/git-history/tree/master/cli) or with the [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pomber.git-file-history).

## Hacking

To run from local checkout:

    yarn install
    yarn start

it'll open the starting page in browser, you'll want to append the path that comes after `https://github.com/`

### Testing & linting

    yarn test

It stays running watching for source changes, press <kbd>w</kbd> for help, <kbd>q</kbd> to quit.

If it says "Code style issues found in the above file(s). Forgot to run Prettier?", run:

    yarn format

### Netlify deploys

Once you submit a PR to `pomber/git-history` repo, Netlify will try to build it a deploy a publicly accessible preview domain such as https://deploy-preview-137--github-history.netlify.com/.
To get the preview URL, look for "deploy/netlify Deploy preview ready!" line, click on "Details" link to its right.
It will also get updated on each push to the PR branch.

If you want to set up hosting and public previews for branches of your fork _before_ you submit a PR:

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/.
2. Login with GitHub.
3. Click "New site from Git" button.
   It'll likely prompt you to give Netlify some access to your repos.
4. Choose your fork of this repo.
5. Under "Build & deploy" settings, set Build command to `yarn build` and Publish directory to `build`.
6. Under "Deploy contexts", configure which branches to build.
